# library_of_alexandria_2.0

This is a project for documenting and presenting information. Ideally, this will simplify political discussions and arguments, but could be used for other purposes. Like a "My Space" for keeping track of arguments and discussions. 

Similar to Wikipedia or Wiki-sites for games etc. Ideally, I would like to implement a data structure that holds Tweets / Xapp posts and allows for convenient retrieval and sorting of pieces of info.
